## Column Descriptions

id - Int value representing unique number for individual
gender - String value representing individual's gender
age - Double value representing individual's age
hypertension - Int value of either 1 or 0 representing whether a person has hypertension
heart_disease - Int value of either 1 or 0 representing whether a person has heart disease
ever_married - String value of either Yes or No representing whether a person has been married
work_type - String value of the type of person's work (I.e. self-employed, private)
residence_type - String value of the type of person's residence (I.e. rural or urban)
avg_glucose_level - Double value of the person's average glucose level
bmi - Double value of the person's bmi
smoking_status - String value describing the person's smoking status
stroke - Int value of either 1 or 0 determining whether the person has had a stroke

## Hypotheses/Question

1. Is there a correlation between being married and having a stroke?
2. Does the person's type of work have a correlation with them having a stroke?
3. Does a person typically have pre-existing health conditions before having a stroke?
4. Does a person's BMI influence their chance of having a stroke?
5. Do men or women tend to have more strokes than the other, or is there no difference between sexes?
6. If a person has high glucose levels, does that increase their chances of having a stroke?
7. If a person smokes regularly, does that increase their chances of having a stroke? If they used to smoke, does that have any effect at all?
8. Do people living in cities have higher chances of a stroke than people living in rural and suburban areas?

## Visualization Plan

All of the questions are related to correlation, so graphs showing correlation would be the best fit.
